# mpd-fzf

mpd-fzf is a [Music Player Daemon][mpd] (mpd) track selector.

mpd-fzf parses the mpd database and passes a list of tracks to the [fzf][fzf] command-line finder. This offers a fast way to explore a music collection interactively.

Tracks are formatted as "Artist - Track {Album} (MM:SS)", defaulting to the filename if there's insufficient information.

Running `mpd-fzf` will send the entire mpd database to fzf, and Enter key will play a track.


## Installation

    go get -u github.com/aver-d/mpd-fzf

Using `go get` you may also need to set the [GOPATH][gopath] environment variable.

Alternatively, assuming `~/bin` in `$PATH`, you could also do

    go build -o ~/bin/mpd-fzf mpd-fzf.go

mpd-fzf calls [mpc][mpc] to play the track, so mpc is a dependency. I could change this to make a direct TCP connection to mpd through Go, but there doesn't seem much need given the ubiquity of mpc.

To install mpc do something likeâ€¦

    $ sudo apt-get install mpc

or

    $ sudo pacman -S mpc


## Run

    $ mpd-fzf
